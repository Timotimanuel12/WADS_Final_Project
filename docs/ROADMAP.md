---

## Phase 0 — Project Setup & Alignment
- [x] Finalize feature scope for MVP (Smart Scheduling, Focus Timer, Progress Dashboard)
- [x] Define repository structure (current single app + shared docs)
- [x] Set up environment variable strategy (`.env.example`)
- [x] Add coding standards (linting, formatting, branch naming, PR checklist)
- [x] Define Definition of Done per feature (UI, API, tests, security checks)

## Phase 1 — UI Foundation (Next.js)
- [x] Build/clean core routes: login, dashboard, calendar, activities, settings
- [x] Connect reusable UI components consistently (cards, tabs, forms, buttons)
- [x] Add client-side state handling for temporary interactions
- [x] Add loading and empty states for each main page
- [x] Add basic responsive behavior for desktop/tablet/mobile

## Phase 2 — Authentication (Firebase Auth + App Session)
- [x] Implement Firebase email/password + Google sign-in flows cleanly
- [x] Add protected route handling for authenticated pages
- [x] Implement backend JWT issuance/verification strategy (if separate backend token is used) (N/A in current frontend-only architecture)
- [x] Add logout flow and session invalidation behavior
- [x] Add auth error handling and user-friendly messages

## Phase 3 — Backend API (Next.js Route Handlers)
- [x] Initialize modular route structure under `app/api/`
- [x] Implement `/api/auth/*` endpoints (register `POST`, session validation `GET`)
- [x] Implement `/api/tasks` CRUD endpoints (`GET`/`POST` + `GET`/`PUT`/`DELETE` by id)
- [x] Implement `/api/sessions` logging endpoint for focus timer data
- [x] Implement `/api/analytics` aggregation endpoint
- [x] Add centralized error handler (`lib/api-response.ts`) + consistent API response format

## Phase 4 — Database Layer (PostgreSQL + Prisma)
- [x] Design Prisma schema (`User`, `Task`, `FocusSession`, optional `Schedule`)
- [x] Create and run initial migrations
- [x] Implement repository/service layer for all data operations
- [x] Enforce per-user data ownership in all queries
- [x] Add seed data script for local development/demo
- [x] Add DB-level constraints (time ordering, non-negative durations, enum-like constraints)
- [x] Add composite indexes for common query paths (`Task.userId + updatedAt`, `FocusSession.userId + completedAt`)
- [x] Use transactions for multi-step write flows where partial failure is risky
- [x] Add pagination/filtering for list endpoints to avoid unbounded scans
- [x] Define migration governance (naming convention, rollback plan, pre-deploy checklist)
- [x] Separate dev/staging/prod database strategy and seed policy per environment
- [x] Document backup/restore runbook (pg_dump/restore) and verification cadence
- [x] Add database observability baseline (slow-query logging + DB error monitoring)

## Phase 5 — Smart Scheduling + AI Integration
- [x] Define scheduling input/output contract (task list + constraints -> schedule)
- [x] Implement deterministic scheduling baseline algorithm first
- [x] Surface deterministic schedule in AI Plan page and calendar AI toggle
- [x] Add AI prioritization endpoint (`/api/ai/prioritize`) — integrated into AI Plan page
- [x] Add burnout detection rule set + recommendation output
- [x] Add fallback behavior when AI service is unavailable
- [x] Add AI planning preferences (preferred hours, max sessions/day, break cadence) (SETTINGS)

## Phase 6 — Focus Timer + Progress Dashboard
- [x] Implement timer start/pause/reset/complete flow
- [x] Persist completed focus sessions to backend
- [x] Build dashboard metrics (completion rate, hours studied, weekly minutes)
- [x] Add priority breakdown metrics visualization
- [x] Ensure analytics are user-scoped and time-filtered
- [x] Add monthly trend visualizations
- [x] Add streak tracking and streak visualizations

## Phase 7 — Security Hardening (WADS focus)
- [x] Validate all request payloads using Zod
- [x] Enforce auth middleware on protected routes
- [x] Add authorization checks on all resource-level operations (row-level security)
- [x] Add rate limiting and abuse protection on auth + critical endpoints
- [x] Secure cookie/token handling strategy (JWT validation middleware)
- [x] Add security test checklist (IDOR, injection, auth bypass, input fuzzing) — tests in `__tests__/integration/security.test.ts`

## Phase 8 — UX/Auth/API Hardening (Post-MVP)
- [x] Run accessibility pass (keyboard navigation, focus order, ARIA labels) — via shadcn/ui components
- [x] Polish responsive UI consistency (spacing, typography, empty/error states) — mobile bottom nav, responsive sidebar
- [x] Improve session-expiry/token-refresh UX handling across protected pages
- [x] Add login-throttling UX messaging for repeated auth failures
- [x] Add account-linking conflict handling notes (Google + email/password)
- [x] Standardize paginated API response metadata (`page`, `pageSize`, `total`) — implemented in task/session endpoints
- [x] Add consistent API error envelope + error-code mapping across all endpoints — via `lib/api-response.ts`

## Phase 9 — Testing & Quality
- [x] Expand unit tests (components, utility functions) — tests in `__tests__/unit/`
- [x] Add backend integration tests for key API paths — tests in `__tests__/integration/`
